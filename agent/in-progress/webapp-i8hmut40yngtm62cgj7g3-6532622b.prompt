You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Can you help me fix this issue?

Previous work summary: 
The network error has been fixed. Here's a summary:

## Root Cause

The **`TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource`** was caused by a **missing ORM file**: `src/components/data/orm/orm_watchlist.ts`. 

Both `src/routes/index.tsx` and `src/hooks/use-trading-api.ts` were importing from this file, but it didn't exist in the codebase. When the browser tried to load the application, it attempted to fetch this module which resulted in a network error.

## Fix Applied

Created the missing `orm_watchlist.ts` file with:
- **WatchlistModel interface** with fields: `id`, `user_id`, `stock_id`, `position`, `data_creator`, `data_updater`, `create_time`, `update_time`
- **WatchlistORM class** (singleton pattern) with full CRUD operations:
  - `getAllWatchlist()`, `insertWatchlist()`, `purgeAllWatchlist()`, `listWatchlist()`
  - Index-based operations: `getWatchlistById`, `setWatchlistById`, `deleteWatchlistById`
  - Composite index operations: `getWatchlistByStockIdUserId`, `deleteWatchlistByStockIdUserId`
  - User-based operations: `getWatchlistByUserId`, `setWatchlistByUserId`, `deleteWatchlistByUserId`
  - Creator/Updater operations for data auditing

The file follows the same pattern as other ORM files in the codebase (e.g., `orm_portfolio.ts`) and is fully compatible with the existing hooks in `use-trading-api.ts`.
