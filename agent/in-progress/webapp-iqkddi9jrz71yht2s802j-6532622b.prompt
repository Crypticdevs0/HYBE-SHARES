You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement: 
I was thinking about making a few updateApp Name Concept: "HYBE INSIGHT"

1. Core Feature: The "Fan-Vestor" Identity

Unlike a standard broker (like Robinhood), this app would link your brokerage account to your Weverse ID.

    Verification Badge: Your Weverse profile gets a "Shareholder" badge (Gold/Platinum based on shares held).

    Tiered Membership:

        1+ Share: Access to the app and digital shareholder ID.

        10+ Shares: 5% Discount on Weverse Shop.

        50+ Shares: Priority access (Pre-sale) for concert tickets (a massive pain point for fans).

        100+ Shares: Invite-only access to IR (Investor Relations) fan-meetings or "Town Halls" with executives.

2. Financial Features (The "Broker" Side)

    Direct Stock Purchase (DSP): Buy fractional shares of HYBE (352820.KS). You could set up a "Biased Recurring Buy" (e.g., "Invest ₩10,000 every time BTS releases a song").

    Dividend Reinvestment (DRIP) into Merch: Instead of cash dividends, you could choose to receive "Weverse Cash" with a 10% bonus, usable for albums or concert tickets.

    Visual Portfolio: Instead of boring charts, your portfolio growth could be visualized with artist themes (e.g., a "NewJeans" theme where the graph color matches their latest album aesthetic).

3. Exclusive Content & Digital Assets (NFTs)

Leveraging their partnership with Dunamu (Upbit) and their NFT platform Momentica:

    Shareholder "TAKEs": Every quarter you hold shares, you receive a limited edition digital collectible (NFT) of a HYBE artist. These are non-tradeable "Proof of HODL" badges.

    Voting Rights 2.0: A simplified, gamified interface to vote at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Instead of complex paperwork, you vote on the app and receive a "Participation Reward" (digital photocard).

4. "Edu-tainment" (Financial Literacy)

To onboard younger fans into the stock market:

    "Idol" Market Briefs: Short video content where distinct AI avatars or actual artists explain quarterly results simply. (e.g., "Here is why our tour revenue went up this quarter!").

    Fandom Analytics: The app would show data that links fan activity to stock performance. Example: "Album sales for SEVENTEEN just hit 5M—here is how that impacts our Q4 revenue projection."
