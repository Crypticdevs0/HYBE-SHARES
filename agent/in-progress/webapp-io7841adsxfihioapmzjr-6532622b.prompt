You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement: 
implement all of them systematically

Previous work summary: 
## Codebase Scan Complete - Build Fixed

I fixed the missing `orm_watchlist.ts` file that was causing the build error. The build now passes.

## Recommended Enhancements Summary

Based on my comprehensive scan of the HYBE Shares K-Pop paper trading platform, here are my **top 10 recommendations** to make it look like a real, production-ready trading platform:

### High Priority (Critical for Realism)

| # | Enhancement | Current State | Why It Matters |
|---|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Transaction History View** | Menu exists, no view | Traders need to see their trade history with P&L |
| 2 | **Candlestick Charts + Technical Indicators** | Basic line charts | Real traders expect OHLC, SMA, RSI, MACD |
| 3 | **Realistic Price Simulation** | Random walk only | Prices need volatility clustering, mean reversion |
| 4 | **Price Alerts System** | Not implemented | Core feature for active traders |
| 5 | **Portfolio Analytics** | Basic value only | Need pie charts, sector breakdown, performance metrics |

### Medium Priority (Engagement & Polish)

| # | Enhancement | Current State | Why It Matters |
|---|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 6 | **Leaderboard & Social Trading** | Claims "50K+ traders" but no social | Drive competition and engagement |
| 7 | **Real K-pop Content** | All `example.com` placeholders | Exclusive content looks fake |
| 8 | **Market News Feed** | None | Real platforms show news affecting prices |
| 9 | **Education Progress Tracking** | Hook exists, no UI | Users can't track learning journey |
| 10 | **Security Settings Page** | Field exists, no page | Missing 2FA toggle, password change |

---

### Current Maturity: ~70%
- Professional UI/UX 
- Core trading mechanics work 
- Missing advanced features and real data integration

Would you like me to implement these enhancements? I can start with the highest-impact items first.
