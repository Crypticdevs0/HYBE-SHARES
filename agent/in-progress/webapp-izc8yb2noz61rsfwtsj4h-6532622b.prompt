You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement: 
scan through the entire system and let me know of your recommended enhancements to make this project look real

Previous work summary: 
I've completed the git setup. Here's a summary:

**Commit:** `fa5e911` - Initial commit: HYBE Shares K-Pop paper trading platform
**Branch:** `main`

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it something like `hybe-shares` or `kpop-paper-trading`
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Connect and push from your local machine:**
   ```bash
   # Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hybe-shares.git
   
   # Push the code
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Or if you prefer SSH:
