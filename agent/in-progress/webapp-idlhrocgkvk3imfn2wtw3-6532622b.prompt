You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary: 
All tasks completed. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Missing Watchlist ORM (`src/components/data/orm/orm_watchlist.ts`)
Created the missing ORM file with complete CRUD operations:
- `WatchlistModel` interface with `user_id`, `stock_id`, `position` fields
- Full CRUD operations (insert, get, set, delete, list, purge)
- Indexes on `Id`, `StockIdUserId`, `UserId`, `DataCreator`, `DataUpdater`

### 2. Notification Bell Added to All Dashboard Pages
Added the notification bell icon with unread count badge to:
- **Trade page** (`src/routes/index.tsx:3463-3476`)
- **Markets page** (`src/routes/index.tsx:4141-4154`)  
- **Account page** (`src/routes/index.tsx:4353-4366`)
- (Portfolio already had the bell icon)

### 3. Real-Time Price Alert Notifications (`src/routes/index.tsx:1428-1461`)
- Added `triggeredAlertIds` state to track which alerts have already triggered
- Price alerts are checked in the market update loop (every 5 seconds)
- When a price alert condition is met, a `PriceAlert` type notification is created
- Alert IDs are tracked to prevent duplicate notifications
