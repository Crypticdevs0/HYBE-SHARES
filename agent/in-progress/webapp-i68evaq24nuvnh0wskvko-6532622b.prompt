You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary: 
The build passes now. Let me summarize what was done:

## Changes Made

1. **Updated HYBE Permit License Placeholder** (`src/routes/index.tsx:2845`)
   - Changed the placeholder from `"e.g., HYBH4CEX464RW"` (which was an actual valid permit code) to `"e.g., HYB3X7K9M2P4Q"` (a random placeholder that is NOT part of the stored valid permit licenses)

2. **Created Missing ORM File** (`src/components/data/orm/orm_watchlist.ts`)
   - Created the `WatchlistORM` class with full CRUD operations following the same pattern as other ORM files in the project
   - This fixed the TypeScript import errors that were blocking the build

The placeholder now shows a random example code (`HYB3X7K9M2P4Q`) that follows the same format as real codes but is not one of the actual valid permit licenses stored in `VALID_HYBE_PERMITS`:
- `HYBH4CEX464RW`
- `HYB10250GB0680`
- `HYB59371A4C9F2`
- `B07200EF6667`
- `HYB07280EF6207`
